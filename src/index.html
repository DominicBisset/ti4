                    I own <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/twilight-imperium-fourth-edition">Twilight Imperium.</a>  Its an eight-hour, six player game. This is not something you pull out casually after dinner.  This takes organisation.

                <p>
                    I'm running a game, starting <strong>10:30</strong> the morning of the <strong>ninth of November 2019</strong>.  If you've been linked to this page, I want you to join me.  I need five dedicated souls willing to simulate a galaxy with me.  Even if you're not that dedicated, you're still welcome to drop by throughout the day and spectate and keep Hannah company.  Perhaps you'll catch the Twilight Imperium bug and want to be first in the queue for the next game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bring your own lunch.  We might have a short interlude to eat, but it won't be long enough to go shopping. We can order takeway or similiar in the evening if we're still going.
                </p>
                <p>

                    If you're not immediately disgusted at the concept of spending an entire day pretending to be diplomatic space tortoises, perhaps look one or more of the following videos by my Games Reviewers of choice <a href="https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/">Shut Up and Sit Down</a>.  They explain it far better than I ever can.

                <h3>SU&amp;SD play TI3</h3>
                <p>Yes it uses the old version of the game but it does capture the emotions that you'll experience.  It ends slightly anticlimatically because they misplayed a rule, but hopefully you get the idea.</p>

		    <p>They also have a <a href="https://youtu.be/8aZyR6tbCaM" alt="SU&amp;SD play TI4 part 1">three-part</a>,  <a href="https://youtu.be/8esRcrDma1s" alt="SU&amp;SD play TI4 part 2">8-hour</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/IeczXEyvDzE" alt="SU&amp;SD play TI4 part 3">stream of TI4</a> if you hate free time.  They do a good job of making it entertaining, but it is a monster commitment.</p>

                <h2>The Commitment</h2>
                <p>
                    I understand if you're not interested in spending an entire day pretending to be an alien race. It's not for everyone.  Its a long time to have a bad time for, so don't be afraid to say it's not for your.  On the assumption that I'm going to get a lot of "no thanks",  I've invited a lot of people and places will be given out on a first-come-first-served basis.  If the five spaces fill up I'll still take a waiting list in case people drop out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So how do I get a place I hear you ask?  To get a place, you need to respond to me and make the following five declarations:
                </p>
                <form name="rsvp" data-netlify="true">
                    <div><input type="checkbox" id="chk_wanttojoin" name="chk_wanttojoin"/><label for="chk_wanttojoin">I <input type="text" name="txt_name" placeholder="&lt;your name here&gt;" required/>declare that I wish to join the game.</label></div>
                    <div><input type="checkbox" id="chk_isabletocome" name="chk_isabletocome"/><label for="chk_isabletocome">I declare that I am at least 95% confident that I will be able to arrive by 10:30am on the third of November 2018, and I am willing to see the game through to completion or 10:30pm whichever is sooner.</label></div>
                    <div><input type="checkbox" id="chk_willreadtherules" name="chk_willreadtherules"/><label for="chk_willreadtherules">I declare that I will read the learn to play rules available from <a href="https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/f3/c6/f3c66512-8e19-4f30-a0d4-d7d75701fd37/ti-k0289_learn_to_playcompressed.pdf">the FFG website</a> in advance at least once to achieve a baseline level of understanding and speed the game up.</label></div>
                    <div><input type="checkbox" id="chk_willactincharacter" name="chk_willactincharacter"/><label for="chk_willactincharacter">I declare that I will act according to the spirit of the game, adopting the persona of the race you play as, engaging in scheming, skulduggery and betrayal as appropriate.</label></div>
                    <div><input type="checkbox" id="chk_willbenice" name="chk_willbenice"/><label for="chk_willbenice">I declare that I understand that what happens in the game stays in the game and will not continue to bear ill-will towards other players outside of the game.</label></div>
                    <input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
                </form>
                <p>
                    Yes, I'm pretty serious about this.  I want this to go well.  I eagerly await your response.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, just turn up and spectate.  It'd be nice to know if you're planning on turning up, when, and how long for though, just so I know when to expect you.  Maybe you could play some smaller board games in the background if enough people are interested.
