                    I own <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/twilight-imperium-fourth-edition">Twilight Imperium.</a>  Its an eight-hour, six player game. This is not something you pull out casually after dinner.  This takes organisation.

                <p>
                    I'll be running a game some time late December or early Jan.  If you've been linked to this page, I want you to join me.  I need five dedicated souls willing to simulate a galaxy with me.  Even if you're not that dedicated, you're still welcome to drop by throughout the day and spectate and keep Hannah company.  Perhaps you'll catch the Twilight Imperium bug and want to be first in the queue for the next game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bring your own lunch.  We might have a short interlude to eat, but it won't be long enough to go shopping. We can order takeway or similiar in the evening if we're still going.
                </p>

                    If you're not immediately disgusted at the concept of spending an entire day pretending to be diplomatic space tortoises, perhaps look one or more of the following videos by my Games Reviewers of choice <a href="https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/">Shut Up and Sit Down</a>.  They explain it far better than I ever can.

                <h3>SU&amp;SD play TI3</h3>
                <p>Yes it uses the old version of the game but it does capture the emotions that you'll experience.  It ends slightly anticlimatically because they misplayed a rule, but hopefully you get the idea.</p>

		    <p>They also have a <a href="https://youtu.be/8aZyR6tbCaM" alt="SU&amp;SD play TI4 part 1">three-part</a>,  <a href="https://youtu.be/8esRcrDma1s" alt="SU&amp;SD play TI4 part 2">8-hour</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/IeczXEyvDzE" alt="SU&amp;SD play TI4 part 3">stream of TI4</a> if you hate free time.  They do a good job of making it entertaining, but it is a monster commitment.</p>

                <p>
                    I understand if you're not interested in spending an entire day pretending to be an alien race. It's not for everyone.  Its a long time to have a bad time for, so don't be afraid to say it's not for you.  On the assumption that I'm going to get a lot of "no thanks",  I've invited a lot of people and places will be given out on a first-come-first-served basis.  If the five spaces fill up I'll still take a waiting list in case people drop out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So how do I get a place I hear you ask?  For now I'm just canvasing availability and interest.  Please fill in <a href="https://doodle.com/poll/3b232mn9qw2s2749?utm_source=poll&utm_medium=link">this doodle poll</a>, if you are. There'll be a more formal sign up in the future when I've settled on a date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yes, I'm pretty serious about this.  I want this to go well.  I eagerly await your response.
