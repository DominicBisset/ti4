                    I own <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/twilight-imperium-fourth-edition">Twilight Imperium.</a>  Its an eight-hour, six player game. This is not something you pull out casually after dinner.  This takes organisation.

                <h2>The event</h2>
                <p>
                    I'll be running a game some time late December or early Jan.  If you've been linked to this page, I want you to join me.  I need five dedicated souls willing to simulate a galaxy with me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bring your own lunch.  We might have a short interlude to eat, but it won't be long enough to go shopping.  We've been lax about this in the past, but this looks like it might be a six player game so our time is even tighter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can order takeway or similiar in the evening if we're still going.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, this is all dependant on Covid restrictions (or lack thereof).  I'm not aiming to be run illicit boardgaming ring here. If lockdowns get instated the game is off. Assuming it is on, I'll be asking you to take a covid test to minimise the danger to one another.

                    If you're not immediately disgusted at the concept of spending an entire day pretending to be diplomatic space tortoises, perhaps look one or more of the following videos by my Games Reviewers of choice <a href="https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/">Shut Up and Sit Down</a>.  They explain it far better than I ever can.

                <h3>SU&amp;SD play TI3</h3>
                <p>Yes it uses the old version of the game but it does capture the emotions that you'll experience.  It ends slightly anticlimatically because they misplayed a rule, but hopefully you get the idea.</p>

		    <p>They also have a <a href="https://youtu.be/8aZyR6tbCaM" alt="SU&amp;SD play TI4 part 1">three-part</a>,  <a href="https://youtu.be/8esRcrDma1s" alt="SU&amp;SD play TI4 part 2">8-hour</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/IeczXEyvDzE" alt="SU&amp;SD play TI4 part 3">stream of TI4</a> if you hate free time.  They do a good job of making it entertaining, but it is a monster commitment.</p>

                <h2>The Commitment</h2>
                <p>
                    I understand if you're not interested in spending an entire day pretending to be an alien race. It's not for everyone.  Its a long time to have a bad time for, so don't be afraid to say it's not for you.  On the assumption that I'm going to get a lot of "no thanks",  I've invited a lot of people and places will be given out on a first-come-first-served basis.  If the five spaces fill up I'll still take a waiting list in case people drop out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So how do I get a place I hear you ask?  To get a place, you need to respond to me and make the following declarations:

                    Yes, I'm pretty serious about this.  I want this to go well.  I eagerly await your response.
